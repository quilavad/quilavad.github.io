This plugin exposes real-time game information for H3VR using a local WebSocket.\
Also included in this repository are example [Overlays](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/tree/main/Overlays) that demonstrate the plugin.

## Installing

- This plugin is available through [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/c/h3vr/p/bacur/H3Status/). Using a mod manager is recommended.
- If [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) is already installed, download the [latest release](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/releases/latest) and place it in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.

## Using the Plugin

**H3Status** does not display anything directly. Rather, it exposes information that can be used to create custom, dynamic interfaces.\
For a detailed overview of this information, see the [Protocol.md](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/blob/main/Protocol.md) file. For practical examples, see the included [Overlays](https://github.com/TakingFire/H3Status/tree/main/Overlays).

> **Note:** This plugin is under active development. Expect breaking changes to the data format and structure.

If you have made an overlay using this plugin and would like to share it, it will be listed here.
